My tiny library of notification sounds

## Why?
I noticed that default notification sounds (both on Android and iOS) 
are pretty sharp, loud and not plesant on the ears. Sometimes I even get scared of them.

I decided to make a collection of notification sounds that I personally like.
They are **nice**, **smooth**, **don't cause any anxiety or fear** and **satisfying** in a sence.
